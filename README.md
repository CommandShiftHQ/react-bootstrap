# React Bootstrap

React boilerplate project for Manchester Codes' projects.

## Getting Started

### Clone down this repository (replace `<your_project_name>`:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:MCRcodes/react-bootstrap.git <your_project_name>
```

### Install dependencies

```bash
npm i
```

### Start up the application:

```bash
npm start
```

### Visit `localhost:8080` in your browser.

You should see a **Hello World** message.

### Change the rendered output

You can change what is mounted to the DOM in `src/index.jsx`. 

It might be a good idea to make an `App` component inside `App.jsx` (will likely handle your layout and routing), and to mount this to the DOM.
